        <p>Sabrina: <em>“Hi everyone! I’m a third year Medical Sciences and Computer Science student here at Western. My favourite part about attending SheHacks+ this year was meeting my wonderful team and learning various new skills that I can’t wait to put into practice! Hope everyone enjoyed their time here and best of luck!”</em></p>
        <p>Mya: <em>“Hi! I’m a second year Computer Science student at University of Toronto. Joining this year SheHacks+ has been an amazing experience. I got to meet and work with new friends, learn new skills, and have fun!”</em></p>
        <p>Hailey: <em>“This is my first hackathon and I have only been coding for a little more than a  year. My first love is Python. I have since learned Java and MatLabs, but in the past two days I have learned how to use GitHub, Figma, HTML and CSS! I even learned how to create the nav bar on this page!! I am in Kinesiology and I would like to work on wearables in the future and taking the data collected to help improve the users health. But I think Kelly (UX Design and Product Design) may have shifted what part of the wearable experience I want to be a part of. ”</em></p>
        <p>Sara: <em>“Hiii! I’m a first year Computer Science student at UWO. This year SheHacks+ was wonderful, it helped me to find great new friends, new skills and a passion to continue my path to the world of Computer Technology. I hope everyone had also enjoyed the contest and found it helpful.”</em></p>

        <p>Here is a simple guessing game you can use to learn Python: </p>
        <p><em>Test this out on your own (maybe on an online Python IDE) and see the magic of coding!!</em></p>
